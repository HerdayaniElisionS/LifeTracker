# LifeTracker: All in One Productivity Web
---
### What it does

LifeTracker is a personal organization web app designed to keep your daily life in sync. Instead of jumping between different applications, LifeTracker brings your schedule, tasks, and finances into one unified dashboard.

* **Smart Planner:** A daily schedule with time validation to ensure your end times always occur after your start times.
* **Persistent Reminders:** A deadlines list that remains visible across all dates until you manually check it off.
* **Expense Manager:** A budget tracker that visualizes your spending using charts.
* **Quick Tasks:** A simple scratch pad for small to dos that do not require specific deadlines.

### Why I built it
1. **The Forgotten Deadline Problem:** Most calendars hide a task once the day passes. I built the Reminders to stay visible until they are actually finished.
2. **Budget Blindness:** It is easy to spend money when you do not see the total for the month. I integrated a budget tool directly into the daily planner flow.
3. **Context Switching:** I wanted a single place to see the schedule and the expenses at the same time.

### How I built it 
* **Backend:** Python with the Django framework
* **Database:** SQLite  
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js
